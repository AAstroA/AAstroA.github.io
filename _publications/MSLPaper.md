This paper considers the problem of detecting impaired and noisy nodes over network. In a distributed algorithm, lots of processing units are incorporating and communicating with each other to reach a global goal. Due to each one's state in the shared environment, they can help the other nodes or mislead them (due to noise or a deliberate attempt). Previous works mainly focused on proper locating agents and weight assignment based on initial environment state to minimize malfunctioning of noisy nodes. We propose an algorithm to be able to adapt sharing weights according to behavior of the agents. Applying the introduced algorithm to a multi-agent RL scenario and the well-known diffusion LMS demonstrates its capability and generality.
