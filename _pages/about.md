Hi, welcome to my site! I'm Alireza Moslemihaghighi, currently pursuing my PhD in Finance at Bocconi University. I have a deep interest in finance and data, and this space is where I share what I’m working on and learning along the way.

Here you’ll find a collection of my **publications**, and a few teaching experiences that I’ve been lucky to be part of. It’s not all polished and perfect, but I hope you’ll find something interesting.

### What’s here?
- **Research and papers** on finance, machine learning, and data.
- And if you're looking for it, my **CV** is available for a more formal overview.

I’m always exploring new questions and challenges, and I enjoy learning from others. If anything here sparks your interest, feel free to look around, or visit [my GitHub](https://github.com/AAstroA) for more projects. I’m open to connecting with others who share similar interests or different perspectives.

Thanks for stopping by.
